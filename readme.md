#Start
This project is designed to view a framework such as Flask.

#File description
```
The file database_postgre.py contains a scripts for creating a database and adding multiple records and output records that contain the database.
The file Program.py contains the entire main part of the project.
```
#Work with the database
```
dbname="#" here you need to enter the name of the database.
user="#" here you need to enter the name of the user you need to create on the database server or use a classic user - postgres.
password="#" enter the password to log in to the database.
port="5432" this setting is almost always the same unless you have changed the configuration on the server.
host="127.0.0.1" I deployed the database locally so I have a classic locale address if you connect to the server databases remotely you need to change this setting.
```
###Not used migration
In this project I did not use migration of a DB because it is very simple project for it the usual small script is enough.

#End
In the future, new features will be added to the project.
